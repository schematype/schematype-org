      <h2>Simple</h2>
      <p>
        SchemaType is designed to be easy for people to work with. Easy to read
        and easy to write, but also easy to use, fork, extend, publish, share
        and maintain. The SchemaType syntax is YAML based combined with a nice,
        compact DSL. Schemas can be published and referenced from source
        control such as GitHub.
      </p>
      <p>
        SchemaType even lets you create and maintain schemas automatically. By
        looking analyzing existing data, SchemaType can generate new schemas or
        make suggestions for improvemnt on existing ones.

      <h2>Social</h2>
      <p>
        SchemaType definitions are meant to be published and reused. Even the
        most core types are no different from types you make yourself. If a
        schema is close to what you want, reference it as a base and add the
        extra properties. If there is a bug in a core schema, fork it, fix it,
        use the fork, submit a patch or pull request.
      </p>
      <p>
        SchemaType makes using and maintaining schema information work the same
        as using and maintaining source code. Schemas act like OO classes; they
        support subclassing, inheritance, polymorphism etc.

      <h2>Powerful</h2>
      <p>
        Think about it... The more specifically you define data, the less code
        you need to write. Schemas can not only validate data, they can
        generate all sorts of functionality that would otherwise need to be
        done by hand. SchemaType aims to make a future where all data is
        defined and can be reasoned on precisely (both by people and by
        computers).
      </p>
      <p>
        Every schema and type defined by SchemaType is (expands to) an
        immutable URL reference. This makes your schemas themselves be
        immutable and therefore trustable by others.
