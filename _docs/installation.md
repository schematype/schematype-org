Getting SchemaType installed and ready-to-go should only take a few minutes.
If it ever becomes a pain, please [file an issue]({{ site.repository }}/issues/new)
(or submit a pull request) describing the issue you
encountered and how we might make the process easier.

### Requirements

Installing SchemaType is easy and straight-forward, but there are a few
requirements you’ll need to make sure your system has before you start.

- Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X
- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)

## Install with NPM

The best way to install SchemaType is via
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/schematype). At the terminal prompt,
simply run the following command to install SchemaType:

{% highlight bash %}
$ npm install schematype
{% endhighlight %}

All of SchemaType’s dependencies are automatically installed by the above
command, so you won’t have to worry about them at all. If you have problems
installing SchemaType, check out the [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/) page or
[report an issue]({{ site.repository }}/issues/new) so the SchemaType
community can improve the experience for everyone.

Now that you’ve got everything installed, let’s get to work!
